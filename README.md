This electronic voting platform is created for official elections of all levels, including city elections. This platform can also be used for schools, communities, and religion organizations. Free and Fair elections are a key component for the legitimacy of the elected candidates and for voters to trust the system. The aim behind this open source project is to create a tamper-proof system without any central control, that is total auditablity and transparency, while always protecting user/voter privacy. This is an Open-Source project, and I followed an Open Government Data policy.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23614482/183789242-126e4c4b-9a08-4d2a-b13a-13b0ecafae90.png)
